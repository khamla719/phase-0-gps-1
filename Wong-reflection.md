What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Some of the git concept I was struggling prior to the session was the process of how to fix merge conflicts. By going through the process of having a merge conflict, it helped out to understand it better.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
The questions I asked the guide was how to pull up the history page and also the process of the GPS.
